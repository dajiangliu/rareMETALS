Description: rareMETALS implements our methodologies for performing rare
    variant associations using summary level statistics. By sharing information
    on the single variant score statistics, and their variance-covariance
    matrix, a variety of rare variant association test can be performed
    centrally. The set of gene-level rare variant tests include simple or
    weighted burden test, sequence kernel association test, and variable
    threshold test. The user can also determine the set of variants they want
    to include in the gene-level test centrally.Additional features for
    rareMETALS package include 1.) A monte-carlo method for evaluating
    statistical significance empirically 2.) methods for performing conditional
    association analysis and dissecting independent association signals.
